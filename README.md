# Loop Quasi-Invariant Chunk Motion

This is a pass which computes the invariance degree of each statement
in loops and inner loops in a way to peel them.

With a relation composition, it is able to hoist an entire invariant or
quasi-invariant inner loop.

## Prerequisites 

This uses the [pycparser](https://github.com/eliben/pycparser).
